# Railway-Managment-System_Intermediate_DBMS_MySQL
In the 4th semester, we have learnt Data Base Management System. We, the group of 3; Dhyey Patel, Raj Patel and I made the project for Railway Management System. We referred IRCTC site and made the flow of our program same. Although we skipped the sheet preference and allocation mechanism, billing portal, we have wrote well enough to demonstrate the system in a working.

#### My role
I worked upon preparing Schema and Entity-Relationship model. Also, helped some of the procedures and functions, specifically one that displays all available trains from one station to other on a fixed date. All of these were written in MySQL using Xampp server. My other friends have applied these functions, triggers to tables created, and finally connected the database with front hand using PHP.

The report, in a pdf formate, contains detailed information about the project.
